Welcome to the NoNamePokemonGame github. This is a game that is based off of PokeIdle Extended (which in turn is based off of PokeIdle). This game is in extreme alpha stage so please do not expect much.

## Developer Setup
You will need node installed, so that the `npm` command is available to use

Run `npm ci` to install the project dependencies

Run `npm start` to compile the sources in watch mode - any code changes will trigger a recompile and update the browser.

The local server will run on `localhost:3000` by default, but should be configurable by passing a `host` or `port` value to the npm command, eg
```
npm start -- --host "0.0.0.0"
npm start -- --port 12345
npm start -- --host "::" --port 7777
```

You should be able to access the local server from other devices on your network (eg, a mobile connected to the same wifi) by hosting on "0.0.0.0"

You can run all Jest tests with the command `npm run test`

## Releasing
This step should only need doing by the project maintainer.

The command `npm run build:gh-pages` can be run to compile all code in production mode,and output to the `docs` folder. Then commit the changes with git and push up to the master branch (or whatever branch gh-pages is set up to track).

## Source Folder Structure
The following diagram is ordered by topic rather than alphabetically, to make finding what you want easier.
Some `.js` files may now be `.ts` files as we are in the process of migrating to Typescript
